					To try out some 3D Java development, I decided to create a first person shooter using the Light Weight Java Game Library(LWJGL),
					I had lots of fun with real time networking, and dynamic world generation a la Minecraft. This application is not meant as a full
					fledged game that is playable from start to finish, but rather a proof of concept and a design challenge. </a>

					<a href ="/test/WaterFlowTextureMaker.exe"><h3>Water Flow Texture Maker</h3>
					In 4th year game dev, everyone was given the opportunity to program a custom shader design of their choice. I was interested in water
					effects, and the professor Wilf Lalonde wanted a quick program that would allow for a spatial vector representation of the direction the
					water should flow. The tool was useful, and gave me an A+ in the class, but its mostly interesting because it makes pretty pictures.

					This little windows executable called to the need of party goers who want to play a drinking game called century club, and 
					listen to music at the same time. When the application starts, you are prompted to point to your music directory. Then the 
					timer starts and begins your playlist. Every 60 seconds, an audio cueue is played, and the next song is played.</a>

					This was my first DirectX game that I made back in grade 11. I didn't know any trigonometry or complex math that would have 
					made my life a lot easier programming this game. So basically it looks like crap. My crowning achievement of this game though
					are the half decent looking meshes I made using 3DS Max and this crappy free .x mesh editor. </a>
